# 2022 - Julie

I used the language [Julia](https://julialang.org/).  
Which aims to be high performance language mostly for Academic/Science works. 

## My Progress

As you can see I only managed to finish the 9th challange due to limited time and also that i was really strugling with Julia's documentation and the overall interface.

## Takeaways

While Julia might be apealling to some its not for me. The biggest disadvantage i found is the documentation when compared to others is subpar, this might be due to the nature of the language and the way functions and objects work in it.
