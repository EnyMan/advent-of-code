# Advent Of Code
My Advent of Code trials in various languages.

Each year will be in different language and each year will have my takeaways from trying that language.

I will be primarly doing the chalange in languages i dont know or i am not profficient in.


The only languages i am proficient in is Python and then i somewhat know Ruby so these two will never be used.


## Languages tried:
